Used for managing one or more Xbox Live accounts
in Minecraft PE / Bedrock 1.16.1X and earlier.

Optional Component for mcpelauncher.

Xbox Live integration of Minecraft Bedrock 1.16.20 and later is mostly handled
inside the native game binary itself (official Xbox Authentication Library)
and no longer requires this project.
