This is an integration of the Ghidra decompiler and Sleigh Disassembler for Rizin.
It is solely based on the decompiler part of Ghidra, which is written entirely in C++,
so Ghidra itself is not required at all and the plugin can be built self-contained.
This project was presented, initially for radare2, at r2con 2019 as part of the Cutter talk.
